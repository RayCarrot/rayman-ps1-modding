# Ability Shop
The premise of this mode is to have a collection goal, an ability shop, and all levels unlocked from the start.

## Rules

__Collectibles__ for the purposes of this mode are:
- Cages
- 1ups
- Finished magicians

Getting any __collectible__ decreases the "Collect" counter (the goal of the mode) and gives you a "Cred". Cred can be spent by pressing _Select_ while in a level and selecting an ability to buy. You can press _Circle_ in the shop to go back to map.

Any vanilla effects from __collectibles__ (gaining life, refilling health for example) are disabled.

You may randomize screen order within levels at the "Options" with the _shoulder buttons_. Seed 0 is vanilla. Betilla screens are removed.

The game starts with all levels unlocked and a basic fist, that only collides with __collectibles__ and rings. "Helped Musician" and "Helped Joe" are also set from the start.
