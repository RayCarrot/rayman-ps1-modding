# Level Effects
This mod adds the ability to set level effects in levels. You can choose which ones to be available, how many to randomly pick in each level and a seed. This can be used both to have random effects in levels or to only choose a single one to use.

A re-implementation of the `INIT_WORLD_STAGE_NAME` function is included simply to get more space in the exe for the mod. The function is identical, but compiles t take up less space.
